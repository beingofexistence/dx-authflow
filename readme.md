## A comprehensive solution to all your web authentication woes

Welcome to **dx-authflow**! 🚀 This project is designed to streamline and secure the authentication process, making it easier for developers to protect user data and enhance the user experience. Say goodbye to complex auth problems and hello to dx-authflow! 🎉

## Features

- **Easy integration**: dx-authflow is compatible with any web framework and supports various authentication methods, such as email/password, social login, OTP, etc. You can integrate dx-authflow into your web app with just a few lines of code.
- **High security**: dx-authflow uses state-of-the-art encryption and hashing algorithms to ensure the safety of user credentials and tokens. It also implements CSRF protection, rate limiting, and other security measures to prevent common attacks.
- **Customizable UI**: dx-authflow provides a set of ready-made UI components for login, signup, password reset, and profile management. You can customize the look and feel of these components to match your web app's style and branding.
- **User management**: dx-authflow comes with a user-friendly dashboard that allows you to manage your users, roles, permissions, and settings. You can also access the user data via a RESTful API or a GraphQL endpoint.

## Installation

To install dx-authflow, you need to have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your system. You can then run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install dx-authflow
```

Alternatively, you can clone this repository and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## Usage

To use dx-authflow in your web app, you need to import it and initialize it with your configuration options. For example:

```javascript
import dxAuthFlow from 'dx-authflow';

const config = {
  // Your configuration options here
};

dxAuthFlow.init(config);
```

You can then use the `dxAuthFlow` object to access the authentication methods and UI components. For example:

```javascript
// To render the login component
dxAuthFlow.renderLogin();

// To sign in a user with email and password
dxAuthFlow.signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password);

// To sign out a user
dxAuthFlow.signOut();
```

## Roadmap

We have some exciting plans for the future development of dx-authflow. Here are some of the features we are working on or considering:

- **Multi-factor authentication**: We want to add support for more secure authentication methods that require more than one factor, such as biometrics, hardware tokens, or SMS codes.
- **OAuth 2.0**: We want to enable users to sign in with their existing accounts from other platforms, such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc., using the OAuth 2.0 protocol.
- **Internationalization**: We want to make dx-authflow accessible to users from different countries and languages, by providing localization options for the UI components and the documentation.
